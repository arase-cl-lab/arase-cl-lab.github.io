        Measuring the similarity between two texts serves as a core technology in NLP, forming the foundation for various applications including information retrieval, question answering, and conversational systems.
        Our primary emphasis lies in paraphrasing, which represent an equivalent meaning through diverse wordings and structures.
        We are dedicated to advancing paraphrase recognition and generation models, with a particular focus on the significance of word and phrase alignment.
        This approach elucidates the rationale behind why two expressions convey the same meaning, enriching our understanding of meaning composition.

        We employ paraphrasing techniques to construct a system to aid language learning and education.
        In language learning, abundant exposure to authentic English texts authored by native speakers, tailored to learners' proficiency levels, is crucial.
        However, such texts are often scarce.
        To tackle this challenge, we are developing text simplification methods capable of transforming advanced texts (written by native speakers) into simpler versions.
        Additionally, we are creating language resources for CALL and developing models for automatic difficulty prediction.

        Medical practitioners spend a significant amount of time in writing textual records, including medical and nursing reports, examination findings, and more.
        Yet, the majority of these documents remain unstructured, posing challenges for effective and efficient reuse.
        In response to this issue, our project focuses on developing technologies to intelligently process medical texts.
        By facilitating their effective use, we aim to enhance the quality of medical care.

        [New project starting in 2024]

        LLMs have dramatically advanced language processing and have widely accepted by society as fundamental information technologies.
        However, despite their widespread adoption, these LLMs are not flawless; issues such as hallucinations, adversarial use for disinformation generation, and the amplification of social biases are well-documented concerns.
        In order to ensure the healthy and safe use of LLMs, it is imperative to identify and rectify such misalignments.
        This project aims to develop technology capable of systematically detecting and evaluating misalignments in LLMs.

        ### Keywords
