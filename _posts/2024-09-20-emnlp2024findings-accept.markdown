Zetsu, Arase, Kajiwara. Edit-Constrained Decoding for Sentence Simplification.

Lexically constrained decoding is useful to control text generations; however, appropriate design for negative constraints has not been well explored. This paper discusses that a naive design may result in a degenerate generation. To address this issue, we proposed edit-operation constraints and their satisfaction constraints for text simplification.
