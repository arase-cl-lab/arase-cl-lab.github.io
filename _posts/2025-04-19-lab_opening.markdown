In conjunction with the first information session of the School of Information Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, we held a laboratory open house. Many people attended the event, and we hope it was an opportunity for you to learn about the atmosphere of our laboratory through an introduction of our research by Dr. Arase and a Q&A session with our current students. Thank you very much for your attendance.
